# practice_tdd
This repo is meant as a starting point to implement a function using tdd.
Simply start writing your unit test and your wished function.

## Starting point
The **master** branch is the starting point for practicing any task.
* my_method should be replaced by your function, in all cmakelists, sourcefiles etc.

## Bowling game
The **bowlingGame** branch is the starting point for the bowling game katta from http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata.

## How to start
git clone git@github.com:mightymichael44/practice_tdd.git --recursive

Open it in Visual Code and add the extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matepek.vscode-catch2-test-adapter for nice visual support.

Happy testing.
