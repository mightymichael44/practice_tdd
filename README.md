# practice_tdd
This repo is meant as a starting point to implement a function using tdd.
Simply start writing your unit test and your wished function.
* my_method should be replaced by your function, in all cmakelists, sourcefiles etc.

The **master** branch is the starting point for practicing any task.
The **bowlingGame** branch is the starting point for the bowling game katta from http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata.
