# practice_tdd
This repo is meant as a starting point to implement a function using tdd.
Simply start writing your unit test and your wished function.
* my_method should be replaced by your function, in all cmakelists, sourcefiles etc.

The master is the starting point for practicing. 

# Clone it
git clone git@github.com:mightymichael44/practice_tdd.git --recursive

Open it in Visual Code and add the extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matepek.vscode-catch2-test-adapter for nice visual support.

Happy testing.
